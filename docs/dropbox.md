# Dropbox

DxE has traditionally used a shared Dropbox account. Access to it is now managed via Okta.

Video footage was formerly all stored on Dropbox, but we have since migrated to a different system (TODO: add link to Media page).

The goal is to stop the use of a shared account and migrate everyone to individual accounts. Individual accounts can be created in the Dropbox Admin Console. DxE has a license for unlimited individual accounts within DxE.
