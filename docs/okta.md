DxE uses Okta as an SSO (single sign-on) provider, mainly for providing users with access to shared apps without revealing the password to them.

# Onboarding process
User must first have a DxE G Suite account, which requires Core approval (see [G Suite](/gsuite)). If they already have a DxE G Suite account, then an Okta account can be made. Okta accounts are created by the Tech team.

(TODO: Explain how to create an account)

# Offboarding process
Okta accounts should be regularly audited to remove access from inactive users.

# Password or two-factor resets
Password resets can be requested by emailing the Tech team. Almira also has access to reset Okta passwords for Stakeholders.

(TODO: Explain how to reset a password or two-facotr)

# Security
All users are required to use Google Authenticator (or similar). This is enforced by the "2FA" group in Okta. (TODO: confirm group name is correct)

A few users are required to use hardware keys. This is enforced by the "FIDO2" group in Okta. (TODO: confirm group name is correct)

# Assigning Apps to Users
