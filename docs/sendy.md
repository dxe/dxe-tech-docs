Sendy is the platform that DxE uses to send mass emails. It is accessible at [sendy.dxe.io](http://sendy.dxetech.org) and via Okta.

# How people are added to mailing lists
There are several ways that people are added to mailing lists, including, but not limited to:

- Sign up form on the bottom of the DxE website
- Sign up form on the bottom of the ARC website
- Signing a petition
- Adding their email to the ADB
- Donating
- Registering for an event on Eventbrite


# Mailing list creation
Mailing lists can be created by any user of Sendy by uploading a CSV. The Tech team can create CSV reports using from our databases upon request.

# Mailing list naming conventions
- Lists that automatically update should begin with an underscore. (TODO: add more info about how lists update via cron jobs)
- Lists that do not automatically update should begin with the date they were created in YYYY.MM.DD format.

# Unsubscribing someone from a mailing list
The ideal way for someone to unsubscribe from a mailing list is to click the "Unsubscribe" link that is at the bottom of an email. This will unsubscribe them from all DxE lists.
